# Pomodoro Timer Desktop

This is an Angular/Electron application that implements the Pomodoro technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. During the work intervals, the application plays a playlist to help the user stay focused, and an alarm sounds during the breaks to signal the change in state.

In addition to the basic Pomodoro functionality, the application allows users to adjust the volume of the playlist, reset the timer, pause/resume the timer, and customize the duration of the work and break intervals to suit their individual needs.

This application is a useful tool for anyone looking to improve their productivity and manage their time more effectively. The combination of Angular and Electron allows it to run on multiple platforms, including desktop and mobile devices. Give it a try and see how it can help you stay focused and get more done!
